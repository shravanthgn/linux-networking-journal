# Day 4 – Passive Learning (HTB Notes)

## What I did today
- Went through HTB Academy Linux Fundamentals notes
- Focused on reading and understanding concepts
- Did not actively practice commands today

## Topics I reviewed passively
- Linux filesystem structure
- Basic navigation concepts (pwd, ls, cd)
- Absolute vs relative paths
- Understanding where commands live in Linux

## What I realized
- Passive learning helps reinforce concepts I struggled with earlier
- Some confusion came from mixing learning and lab environments
- Ubuntu VM is better suited for experimenting freely

## One honest takeaway
Not every day needs hands-on practice. Reading and letting concepts settle is also progress.

## Next goal
Resume active practice in Ubuntu VM and continue Linux fundamentals steadily.
