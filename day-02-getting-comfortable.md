# Day 2 – Getting Comfortable with Ubuntu

## What I did today
- Booted into Ubuntu Desktop VM
- Explored the Ubuntu interface
- Opened Terminal and reviewed basic commands
- Wrote down Linux commands in my physical notebook

## Commands I reviewed
- pwd
- ls
- cd
- ip a
- ping

## What I noticed
- Ubuntu interface feels different but intuitive
- Terminal feels less scary than Day 1
- Networking seems to be working by default

## What I did NOT do
- Did not practice permissions much today
- Did not do deep command practice

## One honest takeaway
Even small exposure helps build familiarity. Showing up matters.

## Next goal
Practice Linux permissions and `chmod` commands.
