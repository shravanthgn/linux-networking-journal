# Day 12 – Python Fundamentals & Variables

## What I did today
- Watched the first two videos of NetworkChuck's Python course.
- Decided to use my Ubuntu VM Terminal (`python3`) as my learning playground instead of Replit.
- Practiced creating and printing variables directly in the Linux terminal.

## Concepts Learned
- **The "Box" Concept:** Variables are labeled containers for data.
- **Data Types:** - Strings (text in quotes)
    - Integers (whole numbers)
    - Floats (decimals)
- **Syntax:** Using `=` to assign values and `print()` to see the output.

## One Takeaway
Using my own Ubuntu terminal for Python feels more "real" than using a browser-based tool. It helps me practice Linux and Python at the same time.
