# Day 14 – Rest & System Management

## What I did today
- Monitored system performance due to 4GB RAM limitations.
- Identified that DuckDuckGo was consuming 400-500MB of RAM, causing system lag.
- Decided to take a rest day to avoid burnout and reset mental energy.

## Key Observations
- 4GB of RAM is a tight constraint when running a browser and a VM simultaneously.
- I need to be more intentional about closing background apps before starting my study sessions.
- Consistency isn't just about "hard work"; it's about knowing when to pause so I can come back stronger.

## Mental Check-in
- Feeling a bit overwhelmed/unfocused today. 
- Goal for next session: Optimize Windows startup to free up more RAM for the Ubuntu VM.
