# Day 3 – Linux Navigation Basics

## What I did today
- Signed in to HBT Academy
- Enrolled in Linux Fundamentals course
- Practiced basic navigation commands in Ubuntu

## Commands I learned and practiced
- pwd
- ls
- cd
- cd ..
- cd ~

## What I understood
- pwd shows the current working directory(location finder)
- ls lists files and folders
- cd is used to move between directories(change directory)
- cd .. moves one level up(or go back to previous state)
- Linux uses a directory tree instead of drives like C: or D:

## What felt better today
- Terminal navigation feels less confusing
- I am starting to understand where I am in the system

## One takeaway
Knowing where you are in the filesystem is the foundation of everything in Linux.

## Next goal
Continue Linux Fundamentals using NetworkChuck videos and HBT Academy labs.

##GREAT THINGS ARE NOT DONE BY IMPULSE, BUT BY A SERIES OF SMALL THINGS BROUGHT TOGETHER.


Paused NetworkChuck video #2 at 10:05. Clarified the difference between `bin` and `/bin`. Learned about absolute vs relative paths.
Learned the difference between relative paths (bin) and absolute paths (/bin). Linux looks in the current directory unless a path starts with /.
Did not actively practice today. Took a mental break to avoid burnout and will resume tomorrow.
