# Day 22 – Resuming after a Gap

## What happened
- Took a one-week break. 
- Feeling some resistance to starting back up, which is okay.

## Today's "Action"
- No active studying today.
- Logged in to keep the habit alive.
- Acknowledged that a gap is part of the journey, not the end of it.

## Next Goal
- Just open the Ubuntu VM tomorrow. No commands required, just open it.
